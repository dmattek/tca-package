# R package for time-course analysis 

To install this package on your local machine:

1. First, you need to install the [devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools) package. You can do this from CRAN. Start R and then type:

```
install.packages("devtools")
```

2. Load the devtools package:

```
library(devtools)
```

3. In most cases, you just use `install_github("author/package")`. For example, with this *tca* package, which exists at [github.com/dmattek/tca-package](github.com/dmattek/tca-package), youâ€™d type:

```
install_github("dmattek/tca-package")
```
